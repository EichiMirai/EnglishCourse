              Making comparisons
              as + adjective + as and as much as
              We often use the structure as + adjective + as or as much as to say if something has, or doesn't have, the same amount of that quality as something else.

              He's not as tall as his brother.
              It's not as expensive as the other hotel.

              like + noun

              She's acting like a child.
              It's like a burger but with big mushrooms instead of bread.
              There are lots of people like us.

              It is also common to make comparisons using like with verbs of the senses.

              It smells like medicine.
              It feels like cotton.

              as if/as though + clause
              As if and as though can be used to compare a real situation to an imaginary situation. They are followed by a clause (a subject and verb).

              You look as if you've seen a ghost.
              I felt as if I was floating above the ground.
              You talk as though we're never going to see each other again.
