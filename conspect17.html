              Level: beginner

              English clauses always have a subject:

              His father has just retired. > He was a teacher. (NOT Was a teacher.)
              I'm waiting for my wife. > She is late. (NOT Is late.)

              ... except for the imperative:

              Go away.
              Play it again, please.

              there
              If there is no other subject, we use there to talk about:

              where or when something is:
              There's an interesting book on the shelf.
              There'll be an eclipse of the moon tonight.

              a number or amount:
              There is plenty of bread left.
              There were twenty people at the meeting.

              something existing or happening:
              There's a small problem.
              There was a nasty fight.

              it
              We use it to talk about:

              times and dates:
              It's nearly one o'clock.
              It's my birthday.

              the weather:
              It's raining.
              It's a lovely day.
              It was getting cold.

              We use it with the verb be and an â€“ing form or to-infinitive to express opinions:

              It's great living here.
              It's nice to meet you.
