              Grammar explanation
              Although, even though, in spite of and despite are all used to link two contrasting ideas or show that one fact makes the other fact surprising. They can all be used at the beginning or in the middle of the sentence.

              We enjoyed the festival, despite the rain.

              The main difference between although, even though, in spite of and despite is that they are used with different structures.

              in spite of / despite
              After in spite of and despite, we use a noun, gerund (-ing form of a verb) or a pronoun.

              The train was cancelled. In spite of that, we arrived on time.

              Note that it is common to use in spite of and despite with the expression the fact that, followed by a subject and verb.

              Despite the fact that he worked very hard, he didn't pass the exam.

              although / even though
              After although and even though, we use a subject and a verb. Even though is slightly stronger and more emphatic than although.

              Though can be used in the same way as although.
